The dataset used for this exploratory analysis consists of monthly individual trip data from January 2018 to December 2018 in CSV format.

## Summary of Findings

- The number of trips peaked around 8-9am and 17-18pm during a day. 
-there were more trips on work days (Mon-Fri) compared to weekends.
 - Summer time was the most popular season of a year, likely due to the weather.
- The riding trips tend to be shorter on Monday through Friday compared to weekends.

-Subscribers use the bike sharing system for work commnute thus most trips were on work days (Mon-Fri) and especially during rush hours 
-customers tend to ride for fun in the afternoon or early evenings over weekends. 
the conclution indicates a pretty stable and efficient usage of the bike sharing system on normal work days, while more casual flexible use on weekends.

## Key Insights for Presentation

Different usage pattern/habit between the two type of riders are seen from the exploration. Subscribers use the system heavily on work days i.e. Monday through Friday whereas customers ride a lot on weekends, especially in the afternoon. Many trips concentrated around 8-9am and 17-18pm on work days for subscribers, yet customers tend to use more in the late afternoon around 17pm Monday to Friday. The efficient/short period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their high concentration on rush hours Monday through Friday, indicating the use is primarily for work commute. The more relaxing and flexible pattern of customer use shows that they're taking advantage of the bike sharing system quite differently from the subscribers, heavily over weekends and in the afternoon, for city tour or leisure purpose probably.
